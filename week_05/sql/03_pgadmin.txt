Using pgadmin:

- create a new blank database with the name "car_dealership"

- create a new table named "users_cars" with the following fields:
    - id (auto increment)
    - userID (refers to "id" in users table)
    - carID (refers to "id" in cars table)


- create a new table named "users" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - first name
    - last name

- create a new table named "cars" with the following fields
    - id (auto increment)
    - make
    - model
    - color
    - year

- populate these tables with at least 5 records each - the more the merrier

- Write the SQL queries to accomplish the following: (write each of your queries below for review)

    - select all records from users
SELECT * FROM users


    - select all records from cars where car make = "Toyota"
SELECT * FROM cars WHERE make = 'Toyota'

    - use a join to select the first name and car model of every user who has bought a car

SELECT users.first_name, cars.model  FROM users
INNER JOIN users_cars ON users_cars."userID" = users.id
INNER JOIN cars ON users_cars."carID" = cars.id

    - use a join to select the first and last name of everyone who has bought a red car

SELECT users.first_name,users.last_name, cars.color FROM users
INNER JOIN users_cars ON users_cars."userID" = users.id
INNER JOIN cars ON users_cars."carID" = cars.id
WHERE cars.color = 'red';


    - use an insert statement to create a new record in each table

INSERT INTO public."users"("id", first_name,last_name)
VALUES

('3','Grace', 'Hopper')


    - use sql to update a record in the "cars" table

UPDATE cars
SET color = 'purple'
WHERE id = 4;

    - delete one record from the database

DELETE FROM users WHERE first_name='Robert';
